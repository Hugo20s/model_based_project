## Projet Title: 

### MixtureClass: Package to perform classification using a Mixture of Mixture Model

## Projet Description: 

This package was made for the Model Based projet for the Master Data Mining of University Lyon 2 in 2022. 

There is an implementation of the Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm and a Classification of the Iris dataset using 
a mixture of mixure model.

This code is written on R with the help of some standard libraries. 

## How to Run: 

The testing code is separated into two files: test_iris.R to test with the iris dataset
and test_minist.R to test with the minist dataset and compare with other Machine Learning models. 

First you just need to install the MixtureClass package:

  > install.packages("MixtureClass_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

and 
  > library(MixtureClass)

afterwards you can run the testing codes.
